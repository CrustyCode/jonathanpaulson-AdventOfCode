My solutions to adventofcode.com puzzles.

I post videos of me solving the puzzles in real-time at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuWLIm0l4sDpEe28t41WITA.

Run with (where 13.in contains the input for that day):
```
pypy 13.py 13.in
```

Each solution should print two lines - the answer for part1 and the answer for part2.
